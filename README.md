# Movie App with React and OMDB API

This is a simple movie app built with React and the OMDB API. The app allows users to search for movies and view their details, as well as add and remove movies from a favorites list.

Getting Started
To get started with the app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org/en/. Once you have Node.js installed, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```javascript
npm install
```
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default web browser. You can also view the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Using the App
The app has two main screens: the search screen and the favorites screen. On the search screen, users can search for movies by title using the search bar. The app will display a list of movies matching the search query, along with their titles, years, and poster images. Users can add a list of their favorite movies and they can also remove a movie from their favorites list by clicking the "Remove Favorite" button.
